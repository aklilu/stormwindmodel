\title{Adds forward speed component to modeled surface wind (C++ version)}
\usage{
degrees_to_radians_Cpp(degrees)
}
\arguments{
\item{wind_sfc_sym}{A numeric vector with maximum 10-meter 1-minute
sustained wind with motion asymmetry removed (m / s).}

\item{tcspd_u}{A numeric vector with the tropical cyclone speed, u-component
(m / s).}

\item{tcspd_v}{A numeric vector with the tropical cyclone speed, v-component
(m / s).}

\item{swd}{A numeric vector with surface wind direction (degree).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector giving asymmeric surface windspeed (m / s)
}
\description{
Adds the storm's forward speed component back into the estimated
surface wind speed at a grid point location.
}
\details{
This function uses equation 12 from Phadke et al. (2003).
